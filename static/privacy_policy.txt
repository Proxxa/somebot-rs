Some Bot currently does not collect data about its users.

Whenever errors occur, error data is not logged. Instead, we ask that you contact us via Discord (@yorip)
with instructions on how to reproduce this error.

User IDs may be stored in the event a user is misusing Some Bot. In this case, a users' ID may be stored
privately, and all requests from these users will be responded to with an ephemeral message indicating
that the user has been banned from use.

This privacy policy may be subject to change, especially in the event that erroneous behavior
becomes common or services which require data collection are supplied.
